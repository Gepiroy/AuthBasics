# AuthBasics
 A basic node.js (fastify) server with token authentification made to improve my skills in backend web dev.
# Requirements
 This server needs MySQL database named "auth_basics" and node.js installed.
 Also it's better to install postman to do some requests to the server.
# Requests
 The root address is **http://0.0.0.0:3000/** (opened for access from foreign sources by changing 0.0.0.0 to host's IPv4)
 /register - 
 /login - 
 /take - 
 *(to be continued)*
# Structure
 The server entry point is **server.js** in the **server_modules** folder, just as the whole internal code of the project.
