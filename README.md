# AuthBasics
 A basic node.js (express) server with token authentication made to improve my skills in backend web dev.
# Requirements
 This server needs MySQL database named "auth_basics" and node.js installed.  
 Also you can install [postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to send requests to the server.
# Requests
 The root address is **http://0.0.0.0:3000/** (opened for access from foreign sources by changing 0.0.0.0 to host's IPv4)
 /auth/register - (to be described)  
 /auth/login - (to be described)  
 /actions/take - (to be described)  
 *(to be continued)*
# Structure
 The server entry point is **server.js** in the **server_modules** folder, just as the whole internal code of the project.
